        <h1>James P. Cleland, PhD</h1>

        <p> I am a postdoctoral researcher in the
            <a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/regulatory-genomics-and-cancer-evolution" target="_blank">Odom lab at the German Cancer Research Center </a> and 
            <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/saez/" target="_blank">Heard lab</a> at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, DE).</p>

        <p> After growing up in sunny Brisbane, Australia, I did my undergraduate training at the University of Queensland and University of California, Berkeley. Then, I relocated to not-so-sunny but otherwise fantastic Dresden, Germany to do my PhD at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics. Between my thesis work on planarian flatworm regeneration and summer interludes at the Marine Biological Laboratory in the USA, I developed a passion for the extreme biology of weird and wonderful creatures hiding in plain sight. Since starting my postdoc in Heidelberg in Jan 2022, I have been trying to figure out why the male liver is more susceptible to cancer than the female one. Toward this goal, I apply a wide range of experimental and computational techniques (e.g. single-cell/spatial transcriptomics, imaging, biochemistry...) and collaborate with dozens of colleagues at DKFZ, EMBL and beyond.</p>
        <p> In the future, I plan to apply the toolkit that I developed as a postdoc to the biological questions I fell in love with as a PhD student: How do some planarian species regenerate their body from tiny pieces of tissue in a matter of days? And why can't all animals do the same? Please reach out if you think your department might be a good fit for such a research program.
        <p> When not in the lab, I can be found travelling (back and forth between DKFZ and EMBL, and also to more exotic places), trying to make a decent flat white (and drink the much better ones at specialty coffee shops) and struggling to keep up with an inifinitely energetic four year old.</p>
